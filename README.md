# PassHashManager
 

Verry simpel Python script for hashing, storing and checking login/account creating infromation. Can be used for creating accounts and for logging into those accounts.
The hashing system includes SHA256, an 32 bytes long salt and 100.000 iterations.

The main purpose of this file is to base everything of it. This is not a ready to go system but only a file with a hashing and storing system. You need to change how the information will get into and out of the system and maybe change the storage system.
